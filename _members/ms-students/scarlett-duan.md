Master Student, Department of Computer Science, Laney Graduate School, Emory University

I'm Yuqing (Scarlett) Duan and I embarked on my journey at Emory University in 2023 fall to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science. I am deeply intrigued by the convergence of computer science and medical health fields. During my leisure, I find solace in immersing myself in music. Currently, my research revolves around a privacy-conscious edge computing system, involving cameras, that facilitates the precise localization and orientation estimation of multiple individuals within indoor environments.

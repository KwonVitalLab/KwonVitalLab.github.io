Master Student, Department of Computer Science, Laney Graduate School, Emory University

Over the course of obtaining my bachelor’s degree in computer science from the University of California, San Diego, I developed a passion for providing support and care for patients when they need it most. This led me to pursue a master’s degree in computer science with a concentration in Biomedical informatics at Emory University in 2023 fall.
I am interested in developing tools and methods to facilitate patient’s access to medical resources. I am also passionate about creating innovative tools for diagnosing and predicting diseases.

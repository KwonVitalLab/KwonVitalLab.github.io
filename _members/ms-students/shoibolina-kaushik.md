Master Student, Department of Computer Science, Laney Graduate School, Emory University

I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at Laney Graduate School. During my undergraduate in India, I cultivated a commitment to contributing to societal betterment through the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning. My previous involvement in collaborative research between Manipal Institute of Technology and Kasturba Medical College fostered a deep appreciation for the convergence of technology and healthcare. At this lab, I aim to contribute to research in enhancing the healthcare system’s effectiveness and accessibility through the creation of dependable and equitable AI systems. Beyond my research endeavors, I enjoy immersing myself in various cultures and savoring different cuisines. I have a strong commitment to community service, having completed 100 hours during my undergraduate studies.

Master Student, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology

I received a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Columbia University, and will begin my Master’s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech in August 2024.
I am enthusiastic about AI’s potential to revolutionize healthcare and create innovative solutions that address the needs of healthcare systems and patients. I am interested in integrating AI technologies, such as machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision, to transform healthcare processes and enhance decision-making in patient care.

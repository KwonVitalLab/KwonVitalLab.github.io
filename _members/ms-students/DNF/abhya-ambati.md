Master Student, Department of Computer Science, Laney Graduate School, Emory University

As a Master's student in Computer Science at Emory University, I am passionate about Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My research is focused on temporal dynamics in LLMs, particularly how AI systems persist and adapt knowledge over time. I have a background in deep learning, statistical modeling, and computational linguistics, but what excites me most is seeking out opportunities to incorporate technology with human behavior. I enjoy looking at AI problems from multiple behavioral perspectives that focus on how people think, interact, and make human decisions to develop systems that are intuitive and effective.  Whether itâ€™s addressing context retention in AI or studying how models evolve, I am enthusiastic about solving complex problems that intersect machine intelligence and human experiences.

Master Student, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology

Dharini Raghavan is currently pursuing her Masterâ€™s in ECE at Georgia Tech. Prior to joining Tech, she was a Research Assistant at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) where she developed a scalable edge multi-view perception framework for localising and tracking mobile robots using ambient vision sensors. This work was funded by NOKIA Research. She was also a research intern at the Robert Bosch Centre at IISc, where she developed a robust keypoint-based multi-robot localization algorithm using external monocular cameras. Before that, she was a Summer Research Fellow at the Frontiers in Imaging Spectroscopy and Theranostic lab at IISc where she developed a lightweight residual network for 3D deconvolution of 3T MRI scans of the human brain. She was also a research intern at the Indian Institute of Technology, Indore and an undergraduate research assistant at Ramaiah Institute of Technology (RIT) where she worked on various exciting endeavours spanning biomedical wearables, computer vision, robotics and biomedical signal processing that were supported by DRDO, AICTE and KSCST, Govt of India. She obtained her bachelor's in ECE from RIT in 2023 where she won the Best Student Award, the Best Project Award and a Merit Award for excellent academic performance. Her undergraduate capstone project is filed as an Indian patent, she has publications in top tier conferences such as ICASSP and ICIP and has won several prestigious awards such as the Summer Research Fellowship by the Indian Academy of Sciences, Avery Dennison Spirit of Invention Scholar Award, Mitacs Globalink Research Award (at University of New Brunswick, Canada) and travel grants from IEEE Signal Processing Society to ICASSP 2022 and ICASSP 2023. Her current research interests are wearable computing, computer vision and trustworthy AI for applications in healthcare.

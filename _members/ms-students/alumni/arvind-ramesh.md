Master Student, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology

I am pursuing my Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering specializing in Telecommunications at Georgia Institute of Technology. I recently interned at Qualcomm, San Diego, working with the Modem Systems Team.  I graduated from National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli (NIT-T) in India (National Ranking #9). Since my Undergraduate studies, I have published four research papers in reputable journals, including a conference in INTERSPEECH (Rank-A Conference) related to Wireless Communications and Signal Processing.

In this lab, my goal is to contribute to research in the Indoor Localization using wearable sensors, BLE and to develop a fusion model in a distributed edge computing system to enhance the system's accuracy.

Arya is pursuing a Master's degree at Georgia Tech, specializing in machine learning. With diverse experience across academia and industry, she most recently worked at the StellarDNN lab at Harvard University researching data augmentation techniques for astronomical datasets using generative computer vision models. Additionally, Arya has experience teaching machine learning concepts to students around the world as a Teaching Fellow at Univ.AI. She also gained corporate experience as a data analyst at Schneider Electric, where she developed data engineering and analytics solutions.
She now aim to leverage her background in deep learning and data science to build end-to-end ML pipelines for AI in medicine. My goal is to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of machine learning for enhanced disease screening, diagnosis, and treatment planning.

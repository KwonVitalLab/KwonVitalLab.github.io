Undergrad Student, Department of Physics and Mathemtics, College of Arts and Science, Emory University

I am a first-generation Colombian-American born in New York City. I am finishing my undergraduate degree in Physics and Mathematics here at Emory University with the intention of going for my MS in Machine Learning and Electrical Engineering. During my time at Emory, I have done research in Soft Condensed Matter and Mathematics research, ranging from Topological Manifolds to Nonnegative Matrix Factorization methods.

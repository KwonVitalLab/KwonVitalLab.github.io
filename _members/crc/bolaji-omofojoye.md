Clinical Research Coordinator, Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, Emory University


I completed my undergraduate degree in public health at the University of North Texas and my masterâ€™s degree in biomedical science at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. My research interest is in increasing access to quality healthcare for underserved communities, particularly through clinical research. I believe that every individual deserves equal access to medical advancements and treatments, regardless of their socioeconomic status. By engaging in clinical research that focuses on providing medical access to underserved communities, I hope to contribute to addressing healthcare disparities and improving health outcomes for all individuals.

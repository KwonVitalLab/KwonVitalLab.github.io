Undergrad Student, Department of Biology and Computer Science, College of Arts and Science, Emory University

I am a Korean-American from Seoul, South Korea. I am currently a Junior at the Emory College of Arts and Science double majoring in biology and computer science with the intention of eventually pursuing a doctorate degree relevant to both my majors. My academic interests lie in the intersection between computer science and biology - how we can use computational methods to advance our understanding of pressing human diseases.

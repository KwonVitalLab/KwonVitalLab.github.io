Undergrad Student, Department of Mathematics , College of Arts and Science, Emory University

Landon Minkow, sophomore at Emory University pursuing a double major in Applied Math & Statistics and Economics. My prior experience involves audio signal processing and writing code for cochlear implants. I am very interested about biomedical research and healthcare, and I am passionate about the design and implementation of medical devices for patient use and for studying disease. 
<!-- I am originally from Chicago, and am a big fan of all things soccer and Star Wars. -->

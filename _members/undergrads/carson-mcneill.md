Undergrad Student, School of Computer Science, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology

Iâ€™m an undergraduate Computer Science student at Georgia Tech, concentrating in Machine Learning and Computer Networks. My goal is to apply computer science to real-world problems in healthcare by developing tools that make clinical work more efficient and focused. I want to build software that allows doctors to spend less time on paperwork and waiting for diagnostic results, and more time treating patients. Ultimately, I hope to create systems that integrate smoothly into medical environments and help improve both the experience and outcomes of care.

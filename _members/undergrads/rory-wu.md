Rory (Tianhe) Wu, junior student at Emory University. I am passionately pursuing a dual major in Mathematics and Biology. My academic interests are primarily focused on the integration of AI in healthcare, with a particular emphasis on Computer Vision. I am especially intrigued by the potential of AI in advancing medical imaging and disease detection. My current research is centered on Movement Disorders, exploring innovative AI applications in this field.

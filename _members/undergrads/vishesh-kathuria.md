Undergraduate Student, School of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology

I'm a rising sophomore majoring in Biomedical Engineering from New Delhi, India. My interests lie in researching Neurodegenerative disease and I have conducted my own research in high school learning about Music Therapy as a supplementary treatment for Alzheimer's disease patients. I am interested in computational biology and using Machine Learning to solve problems pertaining to this field.

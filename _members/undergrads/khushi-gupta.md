Undergraduate Student, School of Computer Science, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology

I'm a junior at Georgia Tech, who is studying Computer Science with a specialization in AI and Human Computer Interaction. My academic interests lie in using AI to make healthcare more cost and work efficient. I eventually want to use technology to make diagnosis of health conditions easier on a large scale, especially in rural environments where access to healthcare is limited. I am also interested in broader computational biology techniques that allow me to use data science to understand biological relationships.

Undergraduate Student, Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, KAIST

Exchange Student, Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology

I'm a senior at Georgia Tech, who is studying Industrial & Systems Engineering with a specialization in AI and Human Computer Interaction. My academic interests lie in using AI to make healthcare more cost and work efficient. I eventually want to use technology to make diagnosis of health conditions easier on a large scale, especially in rural environments where access to healthcare is limited. I am also interested in broader computational biology techniques that allow me to use data science to understand biological relationships.
My research interest lies in Safe and Explainable AI, particularly in the fields of social welfare such as healthcare, finance, and education. I am passionate about addressing societal or national issues like the aging population, severe adolescent mental health, and managing large-scale healthcare services in nursing homes. I believe AI can play a crucial role in addressing the shortage of human labor in healthcare services—like nursing home monitoring, mental health biomarkers, and other brain-related diseases.

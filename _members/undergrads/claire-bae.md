Undergrad Student, Department of Computer Science and Human Health , College of Arts and Science, Emory University

Claire Bae, a current junior at Emory University, is studying Computer Science and Human Health on the pre-med track. Her academic interests lie in the development of technology in the medical field to better and improve cost and work efficiency in healthcare. She aspires to proficiently use biomedical technologies to advance understanding of human diseases and diagnosis. I am interested in exploring the development of computational and therapeutic methods for difficult to measure medical parameters through translational research. I am particularly invested in the cost-efficiency and equity of biomedical technologies.

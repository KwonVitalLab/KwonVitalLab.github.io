Hyeokhyen Kwon, or Hyeok, is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Informatics in Emory University School of Medicine. His research focuses on designing efficient, secure, and privacy-preserving machine learning systems on the network edge using distributed on- and off-body sensors to tackle brain health challenges. His applications lie at the intersection of computer vision, speech analytics, ubiquitous computing, and human activity recognition. He has published in top-tiered journals and conferences, such as, CVPR, ICCV, Ubicomp/ISWC, IMWUT, and Sensors. His Ph.D. research received Samsung Ph.D. Fellowship and an Oracle for Research Award, and he was named a finalist in the Gaetano Borriello Outstanding Student Award at Ubicomp/ISWC 2021, as well as a finalist in Oracle for Research Fellow. During his PostDoc at Emory BMI, he also received the Oracle for Research Award.

Before joining Emory University as a faculty, he was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Department of Biomedical Informatics in Emory University, working with Dr. Gari Clifford and Dr. J Lucas McKay.  

He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science degree at the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA, co-advised by Prof. Thomas Ploetz and Prof. Gregory D. Abowd, and a member of Ubicomp and CBA lab.

Alongside academic works, he has various industrial experiences through internships at Abobe, San Jose, CA; Oculus VR, Pittsburgh, PA; Twosense.AI, Manhattan, NY, and Deargen, Seoul, Korea.

He received his MS degree from KAIST under the supervision of Prof. Yu-Wing Tai and Prof. Jun Tani in Electrical Engineering, and B.Eng. In Electronic Engineering from Sogang Univ.

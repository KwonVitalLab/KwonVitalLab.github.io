Hyeokhyen Kwon, or Hyeok, is an Assistant Professor at Emory Biomedical Informatics. His research focuses on designing efficient, secure, and privacy-preserving machine learning systems using distributed on- and off-body sensors to tackle brain health challenges. His applications lie at the intersection of computer vision, speech analytics, ubiquitous computing, and human activity recognition. He has published in top-tiered journals and conferences, such as CVPR, ICCV, Ubicomp/ISWC, IMWUT, and Sensors. His Ph.D. research received a Samsung Ph.D. Fellowship and an Oracle for Research Award, and he was named a finalist in the Gaetano Borriello Outstanding Student Award at Ubicomp/ISWC 2021, as well as a finalist in Oracle for Research Fellow. During his PostDoc at Emory BMI, he also received the Oracle for Research Award.

He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science degree at the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA, co-advised by Prof. Thomas Ploetz and Prof. Gregory D. Abowd, and a member of Ubicomp and CBA lab and was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Department of Biomedical Informatics in Emory University, working with Dr. Gari Clifford and Dr. J Lucas McKay. 
Alongside academic work, he has various industrial experiences through internships at Abobe, San Jose, CA; Oculus VR, Pittsburgh, PA; Twosense.AI, Manhattan, NY, and Deargen, Seoul, Korea.

He received his MS degree from KAIST under the supervision of Prof. Yu-Wing Tai and Prof. Jun Tani in Electrical Engineering, and B.Eng. In Electronic Engineering from Sogang Univ.

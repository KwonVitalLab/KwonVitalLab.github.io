PostDoctoral Fellow, Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, Emory University

AI/ML in Mobile System for Healthcare

I'm a Postdoc Fellow at Department of Biomedical Informatics in Emory School of Medicine with Dr. Hyeokhyen Kwon. I received my PhD from the School of Engineering & Science at Stevens Institute of Technology. I was very fortunate to be advised by Dr. Sang Won Bae. My research goals focuses on applying my knowledge in applied machine learning, and affective computing to solve problems in various domains, including ubiquitous computing, mental health sensing and interaction techniques. My work has not only resulted in peer-reviewed publications in top-tier venues such as EMBS, MobileHCI, JMIR, and CESUN, but it has also garnered significant attention from the media. My research has been featured in Neuroscience News, Medical Xpress, and Science Daily, highlighting the real-world potential of my work to revolutionize digital mental health interventions.

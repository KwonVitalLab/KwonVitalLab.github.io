# Career
{:.center}

Our research will be designing ML systems on the distributed on- and off-body sensors to tackle mental and brain health challenges. Multidisciplinary research will involve machine learning, computer vision, acoustic sensing, wearables, and human activity recognition. The collaboration will span the fields of biomedical engineering/informatics, computer science, and medicine.

We are looking for motivated and hard-working students, PostDocs, or Research Associates with strong backgrounds in the aforementioned research areas who will join my group. Students from both Georgia Tech and Emory can work with our team!

## PostDoc

The postdoctoral fellow will help design machine learning systems for human movement and behavior analysis using distributed on- and off-body sensors (camera, microphone, or wearables) to tackle mental and brain health challenges. 

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS: 

A doctoral degree or equivalent in an appropriate field. 
Excellent scientific writing ability and strong oral communication skills. The ability to work effectively and collegially with colleagues. 

Candidates are required to have a strong background in at least one of the following areas: Biomedical Engineering, Biomedical Informatics, Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mathematics, or a related field.

- Experience with large volumes of video, speech, or time-series sensor data analytics is essential
- Experience with multi-person tracking systems is a strong plus 
- Experience with multi-view or distributed camera networks and 3D human pose or motion analysis is a strong plus
- Any experience in machine learning on edge computing devices, such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and mobile/wearable devices is a strong plus 
- Any experience in multi-modal recognition systems is preferred
- Experience with computing in cloud environments is preferred 
- Strong programming skills in Python and modern machine learning platforms are preferred 
- Some experience with high-performance computing, server management, and database administration is desired but not required. 
- A strong sense of responsibility to complete research in a timely manner is required.

We are looking for candidates who plan to work with us in person for at least a year.

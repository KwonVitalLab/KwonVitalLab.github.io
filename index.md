| 2025/11/15-2025/11/19 | : 🎙 🌌 We attended [Neuroscience 2025](https://www.sfn.org/meetings/neuroscience-2025) hosted by [Society of Neuroscience (SfN)](https://www.sfn.org/). We gave a talk at the AI/Machine Learning Press Conference on "Integrating Clinician Insights into Markerless Gait Analysis: Toward AI-Driven, Interpretable Gait Assessment". [Lauhitya Reddy](https://kwonvitallab.github.io/members/phd-students/lauhitya-reddy.html) also gave a poster presentation regarding the talk.
| 2025/11/15-2025/11/19 | : 🎙 🌌 Lots of activities took place at the [American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) Annual Meeting 2025](https://amia.org/education-events/amia-2025-annual-symposium). Dr. Kwon served as a steering committee at [Workgroup on Interactive Systems in Healthcare (WISH)](https://sites.google.com/view/wishamia2025/program?authuser=0) and a session chair at [S17: The Known Unknowns: Navigating Uncertainty in Clinical Machine Learning](https://amia.secure-platform.com/symposium/solicitations/102009/sessiongallery/schedule/items/94643) and [S68: The Visual Frontier: Navigating Biomedical Knowledge Through Different Lenses](https://amia.secure-platform.com/symposium/solicitations/102009/sessiongallery/schedule/items/94568). Dr. Kwon also gave a podium talk on "Quantifying Cognitive Decline and Balance in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment using Wearables in Clinical Environments" at [S91: The Informatics Kaleidoscope: Diverse Models for Precision, Prediction, and Population Impact](https://amia.secure-platform.com/symposium/solicitations/102009/sessiongallery/schedule/items/94613). We also presented three posters: "Accessible and Scalable Closed-loop Neuromotor Rehabilitation Using Mobile Computer Vision and Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation" (by Joshua Posen), "Machine Learning of Remote Video Interviews for Quantification of Cognitive Impairment and Psychological Well-Being in Older Adults" (by [Merna Bibara](https://kwonvitallab.github.io/members/phd-students/merna-bibars.html)), and "On the Bias, Fairness and Bias Mitigation for a Wearable-based Freezing of Gait Detection in Parkinson’s Disease" (by [Timothy Odonga](https://kwonvitallab.github.io/members/phd-students/timothy-odonga.html); *Recognized with Inclusive Language*!). |
| 2025/10/13 | : 🎙 Dr. Kwon succeffully organized [10𝑡ℎ International Workshop on Mental Health and Well-being: From Research to Practice in Mental Healthcare](https://ubicomp-mental-health.github.io/) at Espoo, Finland hosted in [ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing/ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing (UbiComp/ISWC)](https://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp-iswc-2025/) at Espoo, Finland. |

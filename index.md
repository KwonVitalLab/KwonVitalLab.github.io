| 2025/12/22 | : Dr. Kwon co-founded [Center for Brain and Behavior AI for Neurohealth Science and Support (BRAINS)](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/research/brains/index.html) with Dr. Samaneh Nasiri, where Drs. Kwon and Nasiri will serve as Co-Directors. BRAINS is dedicated to advance clinically validated, patient-centered AI to accelerate innovation, data-driven assessment, and personalized care. The center includes faculty and support from Georgia Tech, Grady Healthcare, Morehouse School of Medicine, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and Emory Healthcare.
| 2025/12/02-2025/12/07 | : 📖 Our paper on multi-site gait AI for Parkinson's Disease ([Care-PD](https://neurips2025.care-pd.ca/)) is accepted and presented at The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems ([Neurips 2025](https://neurips.cc/)). This is an international collaboration project involving a large team from the University of Toronto, Vector Institute, KITE Research Institute-UHN, Delft University of Technology, CNRS-University of Strasbourg, UIUC, VinUniversity, Federal University of ABC, KU Leuven, Hasselt University, Emory, and the University of Bristol.|
| 2025/11/15-2025/11/19 | : 🎙 🌌 We attended [Neuroscience 2025](https://www.sfn.org/meetings/neuroscience-2025) hosted by [Society of Neuroscience (SfN)](https://www.sfn.org/). We gave a talk at the AI/Machine Learning Press Conference on "Integrating Clinician Insights into Markerless Gait Analysis: Toward AI-Driven, Interpretable Gait Assessment". [Lauhitya Reddy](https://kwonvitallab.github.io/members/phd-students/lauhitya-reddy.html) also gave a poster presentation regarding the talk.
